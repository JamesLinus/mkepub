A tool for ripping content from project gutenberg de and converting
it to epub format.

Note: this requires the rubyzip gem, but sadly it's broken in its current
gem1.9 version. The fix is very easy, though:
After you have installed the rubyzip gem, open the file zip/zip.rb in 
the gem folder (use 'gem env' to find it), and comment out the line
require 'ftools'

I have no idea how to submit a patch at rubyforge, so you'll probably
have to do this yourself until someone else discovers this ;)
