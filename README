A tool for ripping content from project gutenberg de and converting
it to epub format. It has been made for a very specific purpose, but
should be modular enough to be easily extendable, should it be needed.

The program works as follows: the grabber grabs some text and stores
it in a book object. This is book is returned, but also dumped in YAML 
format, so you can add missing metadata by hand.
Afterwards, the epub assembler takes this book object and constructs
an epub file from it. Again, the raw contents of the epub file are dumped,
so you can correct errors by hand and then zip the file yourself.

Also, the book to grab is currently hard-coded in mkepub.rb, which is
ugly but currently sufficient.

Note: this program requires ruby 1.9

Note: this requires the rubyzip gem, but sadly it's broken in its current
gem1.9 version. The fix is very easy, though:
Open the file zip/zip.rb in the gem folder (use 'gem env' to find it), and #
change the following lines:

-require 'ftools'
+require 'fileutils'

-File.move
+FileUtils.move
